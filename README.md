The Blue Alliance Frontend Redesign
====================================
### About
+ This is a complete frontend redesign of the popular scouting website ["The Blue Alliance"](http://thebluealliance.com).
+ We are currently working on creating an intuitive and friendly user-interface.

### Known Issues/TODO
+ Menubar looks weird when the browser window is narrow
+ Robot picture should have simpleviewer enabled
+ Tables should use a tablesorter
+ Add red/blue colors for red/blue alliance teams
+ Photos should use fancybox - code implemented, just needs to be tweaked
+ Buttons need to be fixed, something is most likely blocking bootstrap
