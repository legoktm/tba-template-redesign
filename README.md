The Blue Alliance Frontend Redesign
====================================
### About
+ This is a complete frontend redesign of the popular scouting website ["The Blue Alliance"](http://thebluealliance.com).
+ We are currently working on creating an intuitive and friendly user-interface.

### Known Issues/TODO
+ Menubar looks weird when the browser window is narrow (changes styles based for mobile or something)
+ Robot picture should have simpleviewer enabled
+ Tables should use a tablesorter
+ Photos should use fancybox - code implemented, just needs to be tweaked
